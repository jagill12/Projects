# Burrows–Wheeler Transform

This project implements the Burrows–Wheeler Transform, a reversible text transformation used in data compression and fast sequence alignment.

## Overview
The algorithm rearranges a string into a form that clusters similar characters together, improving compressibility and enabling efficient searching. The project includes both the forward and inverse transforms, demonstrating how BWT is applied in bioinformatics for rapid read alignment.
