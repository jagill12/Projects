# De Bruijn Graph Assembly

This project implements a De Bruijn Graph algorithm for sequence assembly, demonstrating how overlapping k-mers can reconstruct a genome or text string efficiently.

## Overview
The algorithm decomposes an input string into overlapping k-mers and builds a directed graph where nodes represent (k-1)-mers and edges represent overlaps. It then traverses the graph to reconstruct the original sequence, illustrating the foundational approach used in modern genome assemblers.

This project highlights core concepts in bioinformatics algorithms, graph theory, and string reconstruction.
